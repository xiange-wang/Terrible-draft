      GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of the market value of all final 
      goods and services produced within a country or region over a specific period.
      It is commonly used as an indicator of a nation's economic health and its rate
       of economic growth.
      <br><br>
      Energy consumption is an integral part of economic activities, as it provides 
      the necessary power for various production and service operations. There's a 
      close link between GDP and energy consumption. Typically, economic growth is 
      accompanied by an increase in energy demand because producing more goods and 
      services requires more energy.

      The ranking of GDP signifies a country's economic stature and influence on the 
      global stage. It offers a comparative snapshot of nations' economic health and 
      their capacity to produce goods and services. A higher GDP rank often correlates 
      with increased global influence, better living standards, and advanced infrastructure. 
      <br><br>
      However, with technological advancements and improvements in energy efficiency, 
      some countries might experience economic growth while reducing their energy consumption. 
      In essence, the relationship between GDP and energy consumption highlights the 
      balance and interplay between economic development and resource utilization.

    Energy mix represents the proportion of various energy sources in a country's total 
    energy consumption. This composition is crucial as it reflects a nation's energy security, 
    environmental impact, and economic stability. A diversified energy mix reduces dependence 
    on a single source, thus mitigating risks associated with supply disruptions. Moreover, a 
    shift towards renewable sources indicates a commitment to sustainable development and a 
    decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Analyzing the energy mix aids policymakers in setting 
    strategic priorities and addressing future energy needs.
    <br><br>
    The potential for change in the energy landscape is vast, driven by technological advancements, 
    environmental concerns, and market dynamics. With increasing global awareness about climate change, 
    there's a push towards cleaner energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. Breakthroughs 
    in battery storage and smart grids can revolutionize the way energy is stored and distributed. Additionally, 
    geopolitical factors and economic incentives can accelerate the transition from fossil fuels. However, this 
    change also poses challenges, such as infrastructure adaptation and job displacement, which need careful consideration.
